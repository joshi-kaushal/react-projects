# react-projects
A single repository for all my mini projects I developed during learning React.

## About react-projects
Creating individual repository for individual projects is fine. But this is why I created a single repo for these projects:
1. Project scope were too small
2. They were created in my learning phase
3. Having a individual repo for every small project might have been oerwhelming (since they were small)

So I decided to have them inside a single repository. I followed John Smigla's react project tutorial uploaded on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo) and made a few changes as I learnt.

### But wait!
I did not just copy pasted his code to build my projects. I watched his work, understood it myself, and code without looking. Of course took help whenever I was stuck for a lont time.

And that's not it! I entirely built this using Tailwind CSS, since I wanted to improve it anyway.
